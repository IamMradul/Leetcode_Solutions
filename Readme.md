# 📘 LeetCode Solutions in C++

This repository contains my solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems, written in **C++17**.  
The solutions are structured so they can be:

- **Directly submitted on LeetCode** (only the `class Solution` part is required).  
- **Run and tested locally in VS Code** with a simple `main()` function for debugging.  

---

## 🔹 Features
- Minimal, clean boilerplate code for every problem.  
- Organized folder structure with consistent naming:
  - `0001-two-sum.cpp`
  - `0053-maximum-subarray.cpp`
  - `0118-pascals-triangle.cpp`
- Local test harness included in each file.  
- Easy to extend for new problems.
